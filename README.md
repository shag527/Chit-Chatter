# Chit-Chatter

This is a very basic chatbot made by utlising the Python's NLTK library. It's a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills,but still a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots. Also, deep neural networks are created using tklearn library.

The idea of this project was not to create some SOTA chatbot with exceptional cognitive skills but just to utilise and test  Python skills. It is created to stepp into the world of NLP and  make use of newly acquired knowledge.
